# My solutions to the Clojure Koans

This repository contains my personal solutions to the Clojure Koans.

The Clojure Koans are a fun and easy way to get started with Clojure - no
experience assumed or required.

## Proof of Completion

### Credits

These exercises were started by [Aaron Bedra](http://github.com/abedra) of
[Relevance, Inc.](http://github.com/relevance) in early 2010, as a learning
tool for newcomers to functional programming. Aaron's macro-fu makes these
koans extremely simple and fun to use, and to improve upon, and without
Relevance's initiative, this project would not exist.

Using the [koans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koan) metaphor as a tool for
learning a programming language started with the
[Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com) by [EdgeCase](http://github.com/edgecase).
